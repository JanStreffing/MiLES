## WHAT IS MiLES?

**MiLES** is a tool for estimating properties of mid-latitude climate in Global Climate Models
and Reanalysis datasets. It has been originally thought for EC-Earth output and then
it has been extended to any model data. It is based uniquely on R and CDO.
It works on daily 500hPa geopotential height data and produces NetCDF4 outputs and climatological figures 
for the chosen time period (over the for standard 4 seasons) in 3 different output format. 
Data are interpolated on a common 2.5x2.5 grid using CDO.  
Model data are compated against ECMWF ERA-INTERIM reanalysis for a standard period (1979-2014) or with any 
other MiLES-generated data

Current version includes:
1. 	**2D Atmospheric blocking**: following the index by *Davini et al. (2012)*.
	It is a 2D version of *Tibaldi and Molteni (1990)* for Northern Hemisphere
	atmospheric blocking evaluating meridional gradient reversal at 500hPa.
	It includes also Meridional Gradient Index and Blocking Intensity index
	and Rossby wave orientation index, computing both Instantenous Blocking and Blocking Events.
	Full timeseries and climatologies are provided in NetCDF4 Zip format.

2. 	**Z500 Empirical Orthogonal Functions**: Based on CDO "eofs" function.
	First 4 EOFs for North Atlantic (over the 90W-40E 20N-85N box) and Northern Hemisphere (20N-85N).
	NAO, EA, and Arctic Oscillation are thus computed. 
	Figures of linear regression are provided.
	PCs and eigenvectors, as well as the variances explained are provided in NetCDF4 Zip format.

3.	**North Atlantic Weather Regimes (beta)**: following k-means clustering of 500hPa geopotential height.
	4 weather regimes over North Atlantic (80W-40E 30N-87.5N) are evaluted using 
	anomalies from daily seasonal cycle. North Atlantic 4 EOFs are computed to reduce 
	the phase-space dimension and then k-means clustering using Hartigan-Wong algorithm with k=4 is computed. 
	Figures report patterns and frequencies of occurrence. NetCDF4 Zip data are saved.
	*Only 4 regimes and DJF is supported so far.*

Please be aware that this is free tool in continous development, then it may not be 
free of bugs. Please report any issue at p.davini@isac.cnr.it

## SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS

* a. R version >3.0
* b. CDO version > 1.6.5, compiled with netCDF4
* c. Compiling environment (gcc)

IMPORTANT: there are 2 R packages (maps and ncdf4) needed to run **MiLES**.
You have to run "Rscript config/installpack.R" as first step in order to install the packages.
If everything runs fine, their installation is performed by an automated 
routine that brings the user through the standard web-based installation. 
Packages are also included in **MiLES** and can be installed offline.

The installation of some packages requires specifically gfortran-4.8: there is an issue known on 
Mac OS X (10.11 and later at least) which requires a few turnarounds. See here for help:

-----------------

## HOW TO

Before running **MiLES** R packages should installed (see above).
Also, config/config_$MACHINE.sh should be set accordingly to your local configuration.
It is a trivial configuration, needing only information on CDO/R paths and some folders definition.

The simplest way to run **MiLES** is simply executing in bash environment "wrapper_miles.sh". 
Options as seasons, which EOFs compute, reference dataset or file format can be specified at this stage.
All the chain of scripts will be executed as a sequence.

However, each **MiLES** script can be run autonomously from command line providing the correct sequence of arguments.
R-based script are written as functions and thus can be called inside R if needed.  

* "z500_prepare.sh". **MiLES** is based on a pre-processing of data. 
This script expects daily 500hPa geopotential height data in a single folder: it interpolates data on a 2.5x2.5 grid,
it selects the NH only and it organizes their structure and their features in order to make them handable by MiLES.
You can use both geopotential or geopotential height data, the former will be automatically converted.   

* "eof_fast.sh" and "eof_figure.R". EOFs are computed using CDO in bash environment by the former script, while the latter
provides the figures with an R script. EOFs signs for the main EOFs are checked in order to maintain consistency.

* "blocking_fast.R" and "blocking_figures.R". blocking analysis is performed by the first R script. The second provides the figures.

* "regimes_fast.R" and "regimes_figures.R". Weather regimes analysis is performed by the first R script. The second provides the figures.

Figures are extremely basic: they can be produced in pdf, png and eps format.
Properties (e.g. resolution, palettes) can be modified playing with the config/config.R file.
