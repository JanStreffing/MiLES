# please specify one or more of the 4 standard seasons using 3 characters.
# std_clim is supported for these 4 seasons only.
# To analyse the whole year use "ALL"
# Beta: now you can define your own season putting together 3-character string for each consecutive month you
# want to include, for example "Jan_Feb_Mar".

# "NAO": the 4 first  EOFs of North Atlantic, i.e. North Atlantic Oscillation as EOF1
# "AO" : the 4 first EOFs of Northern Hemispiere, i.e. Arctic Oscillation as EOF1 
# "PNA": the 4 first EOFs of North Pacific, i.e. Pacific North American Pattern as EOF1 (beta)
# "lon1_lon2_lat1_lat2" : custom regions for EOFs: beware that std_clim will be set to false!
